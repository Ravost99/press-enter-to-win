# Press enter to win (in python)
A simple clicker game, but all you need is an enter key!

Press the enter key to score high! Buy things at the shop to increase your points per enter, points per second (coming soon) or chance enters (read below). You don't even need good CPS, just hold down your enter key!

### Need help on:
- Better prices (depends on what the community thinks)
- Readability
-->

## Information & Help <!-- Helpdesk? -->
**PPS loading**

If you do not see a space (as seen below) underneath all the help commands, it means the pps system has not been loaded correctly, and you won't earn idle enters.

Try rerunning the repl or updating the file from github (coming soon)

**Replit icon bug**

If somehow the replit icon does not load in the console, I don't really have a fix for that right now, but I may add a settings where you can use a '>' instead. The bug will look something like "‚êª"
