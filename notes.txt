Pretty much, you press the enter key to get enters, use those enters to buy items that can increase your enters per enter or enters per second

PPS name ideas!!
Alien higher up in list
Console editor highest in list
Alternate universe (dimension) pretty high in list
sixth sense? already have sixth finger (summon enters in every time the seconds change -> every second)
automatick enter-er lowest
enter clock?
what? get enters without even knowing it lowest
time machine -> travel forward and back to get lots of enters

use replit db for saving? Means people will have to install packages to run
could also make a seperate repl with packages and saving

~withing the forever loop, (line 142ish)
every second add your pps to enters, even if you don't press enter and go thru the loop again <-- where I'm stumped

difference in start_time seconds?~
seperate forever loop? ---> subprocess within file using threading
"import subprocess" kinda worked, not as I wanted it to tho, threading worked better
